## What is this application all about?

This is a simple app that dynamically fetches and views a list of videos.

You can also click on the video card to navigate to another page, where you can play the video and see details related to the video.

## Where did the videos come from?

The fetched data is a result of an API request, created by Backend side of this application.
Please refere to [Backend README.md](https://github.com/yasserzakyw/React-Strapi---tldv/blob/master/video-player-backend/README.md) for more information.
