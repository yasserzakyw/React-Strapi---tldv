# Video Player App 📽

- This section is simple complete application container that contains:
  - [Frontend (_ReactJS_)]()
  - [Backend CMS (_NodeJS, MongoDB_)]()
- It is mainly developed for my friends at [tl;dv](https://tldv.io/) 🙋🏻‍♂️

## What is this application all about?

This is a simple app that dynamically fetches and views a list of videos.

You can also click on the video card to navigate to another page, where you can play the video and see details related to the video.

## Where did the videos come from?

The fetched data is a result of an API request, created by Backend side of this application.
