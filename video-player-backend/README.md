# Getting Started Video Player App | Backend (Strapi) ðŸ’¿

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

### `develop`

- Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

  ```
  npm run develop
  ```

  OR

  ```
  yarn develop
  ```

- Open [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to view the admin panel in your browser.

- For the first time to open the newly build Admin UI Panel, you will see a registration form that is needed to creat the first admin user (_Super Admin_) and authenticate it.

- If you run the frontend first without setting up the user first, you will see the UI with no data to be displayed.
  - This is where I usually create another component for Not Data handeling behaviour. But I kept it simple here with just a text.
